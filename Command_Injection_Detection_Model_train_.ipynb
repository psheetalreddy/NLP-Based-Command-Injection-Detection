        "## Overview\n",
        "This project implements an advanced security system designed to protect web applications from **Command Injection** attacks. By leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning, the system identifies malicious patterns in user inputs that traditional signature-based filters might miss.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Key Features\n",
        "- **NLP-Powered Detection:** Uses `TfidfVectorizer` with character-level n-grams (2-4) to capture structural nuances of command injection payloads.\n",
        "- **Automated ML Pipeline:** Integrates preprocessing and classification into a robust `sklearn.pipeline`.\n",
        "- **Hyperparameter Optimization:** Utilizes `GridSearchCV` to optimize Logistic Regression and Random Forest models.\n",
        "- **Middleware Simulation:** Includes logic to categorize inputs into `BLOCK`, `LOG_AND_ALLOW`, or `ALLOW` based on confidence thresholds.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Tech Stack\n",
        "- **Language:** Python\n",
        "- **Libraries:** Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib\n",
        "- **Techniques:** TF-IDF (Char n-grams), Logistic Regression, Random Forest\n",
        "\n",
        "## Getting Started\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. Data Preparation\n",
        "Before training the model, you must generate the training data:\n",
        "- Run the **Dataset Creation Notebook** (e.g., `Dataset_Generator.ipynb`). This script will synthesize a balanced dataset of benign and malicious strings and save it as `advanced_command_injection_dataset.jsonl` in the project directory.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. Installation\n",
        "Install the required Python dependencies:\n",
        "```bash\n",
        "pip install pandas scikit-learn seaborn matplotlib\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. Training and Evaluation\n",
        "- Run the main project notebook to load the generated `.jsonl` file.\n",
        "- The script will perform a stratified split, tune hyperparameters, and save the best-performing pipeline to `adv_model/Logistic_Regression_pipeline.pkl`.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. Deployment Simulation\n",
        "Use the `inspect_input()` function within the notebook to test the real-time middleware logic against custom strings.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Results\n",
        "- **Best Model:** Logistic Regression (C=10)\n",
